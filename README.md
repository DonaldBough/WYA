#WYA (Where You At)

##What it does
I don't know about you, but waiting on your friends to show up somewhere sucks. WYA makes life a little simpler by letting you send a GPS request to friends. Initial commit right now. Future features include:

GPS Requests,Event Timeline, Privacy, Settings, Facebook Integeration, GroupMe Integeration
